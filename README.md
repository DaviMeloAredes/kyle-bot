# Kyle, the bot
A multi-purpose bot written in **TypeScript**, with **MongoDB database**.

## Mission

Kyle's mission is to compress a number of diverse functionalities, **necessary** or **not**, into a single bot, eliminating the need to add multiple bots for different purposes. All this, without losing **efficiency**, **performance**, or **practicality**.
